# Access Keys for WordPress Menus
The WordPress Access Keys Plugin allows you to add access keys to your navigation menus to improve accessibility of your WordPress website.

This is an update of an existing plugin on the wordpress repository, it has been abandoned for 7 years but I have been unable to find anything that does the same thing.

The original plugin page can be found here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-nav-menus-access-keys/
